            <h2>Coordination with the French Resistance</h2>
            <p>Through the London-based <em>État-major des Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur</em> (French Forces of the Interior), the British Special Operations Executive orchestrated a massive campaign of sabotage to be implemented by the French Resistance. The Allies developed four plans for the Resistance to execute on D-Day and the following days:</p>

            <ul><li>Plan <em>Vert</em> was a 15-day operation to sabotage the rail system.</li>
                <li>Plan <em>Bleu</em> dealt with destroying electrical facilities.</li>
                <li>Plan <em>Tortue</em> was a delaying operation aimed at the enemy forces that would potentially reinforce Axis forces at Normandy.</li>
                <li>Plan <em>Violet</em> dealt with cutting underground telephone and teleprinter cables.</li></ul>

            <p>The resistance was alerted to carry out these tasks <em>by messages personnels</em> transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.</p>

<p>A 1965 report from the Counter-insurgency Information Analysis Center details the results of the French Resistance's sabotage efforts: "In the southeast, 52 locomotives were destroyed on 6 June and the railway line cut in more than 500 places. Normandy was isolated as of 7 June."</p>

            <h2>Naval Activity</h2>
            <p>Naval operations for the invasion were described by historian Correlli Barnett as a "never surpassed masterpiece of planning". In overall command was British Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who had served as Flag officer at Dover during the Dunkirk evacuation four years earlier. He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942, and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily the following year.</p>

            <p>The invasion fleet was drawn from eight different navies, comprising 6,939 vessels: 1,213 warships, 4,126 landing craft of various types, 736 ancillary craft, and 864 merchant vessels. The majority of the fleet was supplied by the UK, which provided 892 warships and 3,261 landing craft. There were 195,700 naval personnel involved. The invasion fleet was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral Alan G Kirk) supporting the American sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir Philip Vian) in the British and Canadian sectors. Available to the fleet were five battleships, 20 cruisers, 65 destroyers, and two monitors. German ships in the area on D-Day included three torpedo boats, 29 fast attack craft, 36 R boats, and 36 minesweepers and patrol boats. The Germans also had several U-boats available, and all the approaches had been heavily mined.</p>

        <h3>Naval Losses</h3>
            
            <p>At 05:10, four German torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force and launched fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS <em>Svenner</em> off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS <em>Warspite</em> and <em>Ramillies</em>. After attacking, the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS <em>Corry</em> off Utah and USS <em>PC-1261</em>, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.</p>

            <h2>Bombardment</h2>
            <p>Bombing of Normandy began around midnight with more than 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely ineffective at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.</p>

            <p>Minesweepers began clearing channels for the invasion fleet shortly after midnight and finished just after dawn without encountering the enemy. The Western Task Force included the battleships <em>Arkansas</em>, <em>Nevada</em>, and <em>Texas</em>, plus eight cruisers, 28 destroyers, and one monitor. The Eastern Task Force included the battleships <em>Ramillies</em> and <em>Warspite</em> and the monitor <em>Roberts</em>, twelve cruisers, and thirty-seven destroyers. Naval bombardment of areas behind the beach commenced at 05:45, while it was still dark, with the gunners switching to pre-assigned targets on the beach as soon as it was light enough to see, at 05:50. Since troops were scheduled to land at Utah and Omaha starting at 06:30 (an hour earlier than the British beaches), these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before the assault troops began to land on the shore.</p>
